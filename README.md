# Brand-Analysis
This repository is intended to show how to obtain data and do meaningful analyses with said data. We will be analysing fashion/retail brands by looking at their websites, social media and store locations. 
We will be implementing basic stuff like Exploratory Analysis and more advanced things like machine learning applications on scraped data.

All the data in this project is scraped from three different sources
- Instagram
- Shopify
- Google Maps
